# Shifu Demo

This is the demo for the [Shifu Content Management System](https://github.com/emvi/shifu).

To run it, you need to install Shifu and start it inside the root directory of this project. Do not deploy this to production as is! The admin password (and other secrets potentially) is hard-coded!
